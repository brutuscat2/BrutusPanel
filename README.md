BrutusPanel
===========

An easy-to-use PHP minecraft server control panel.

Demo located at http://route1.sb-network.net/panel

Installation: <br />
1. Install RemoteToolKit <br />
2. Install our RTK module into the modules folder of RemoteToolKit <br />
3. Start your server, a unique hash will be generated when you type /bp hash. This will only be generated once. <br />
4. Copy all of the control panel files over to your web server. <br />
5. Go to http://yourdomain.com/install. Remember to replace yourdomain.com with your real domain, and use the path you put the panel in.

Features:
- Easy to use
- Fairly easy to install
- Very capable

TODO:
- Add installer
- Add login script (done)
- Add login checks (done, not tested)
- Add way to read servers from MySQL
- Instead of navbar on each page, use php include (Done, not tested, but I'm confident in it)
- Add checks to make sure you can't access other servers
- Make a module for RTK so the CP can interface with the MC server, and do a lot of cool stuff.
